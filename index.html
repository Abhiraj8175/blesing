    <h1>My Shreya</h1>
    <p>You say you don’t deserve a rhodium, but to me, <strong>you are</strong> the rhodium — rare, priceless, and irreplaceable. You deserve it all.</p>
    <p>And let me be very clear:<br><strong>I will never leave you.</strong></p>
    <p>I will be there for you — in pain, in joy, in every silent moment, and in every storm. I will protect you at any cost, because you are not just someone in my life — <strong>you are my dopamine and oxytoxin.</strong></p>
    <p>You are the most important person in this entire universe. Without you, I am nothing. <em>Literally, nothing.</em> So how could I ever think of leaving you?</p>
    <p>You are the cause of my happiness, the rhythm in my silence, the warmth in my soul.</p>
    <p>You don’t even realize, but you heal me — your presence cures every invisible wound, every ache, every void.</p>
    <p>You are that person... for whom no language ever created enough words. No poem, no paragraph could ever capture what you mean to me.</p>
    <p>So no more blaming yourself, no more doubting your worth.</p>
    <p> People say's <strong>"You are enough"</strong> but i will say you are more then <strong>enough</strong> for me, you are the god's <strong>grace and blessing </strong> for me. </p>
    <p>You are mine. And I'm yours. <strong>Forever.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>"Not by blood, but by the soul we blend, A lifetime bond that will never end."</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for being you, for being my Shreya. I admire  you more than words can ever say.</p>
    <p>With all my love,</p>
    <p class="heart">— Abhiraj ❤️</p>
